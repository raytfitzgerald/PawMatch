## Project Description

**PawMatch** is a mobile application designed to help users connect with local dog shelters for fostering, walking, or spending time with dogs in need. Using a Tinder-style swipe interface, users can match with dogs available in nearby shelters. The main objective of the app is to promote dog socialization and encourage fostering and adoption.

## App Features

### User Interface

- **Swipe Interface:** Users can swipe right to show interest in a dog and left to skip. Each dog's profile is displayed on a card-based UI with photos and essential information.
- **Dog Profile Card:** Displays the dog's name, breed, age, size, personality traits, shelter name, and distance from the user. Multiple images of the dog are available.
- **Match Screen:** If a user and shelter both indicate interest, an ‘It’s a Match!’ screen appears with options to contact the shelter.

### User Registration & Profiles

- **User Sign-Up/Login:** Users can sign up or log in using email, Google, or social media accounts.
- **Profile Setup:** Users provide information such as name, location, availability, and dog preferences. A short bio can be added to describe their experience with dogs.

### Dog Browsing & Matching

- **Dog Feed:** Displays a feed of dogs from nearby shelters based on user location and preferences.
- **Filters:** Users can filter dogs by breed, size, age, distance, and needs (e.g., fostering, walking, playtime).
- **Match Criteria:** Shelters can set criteria for each dog, such as preferred experience level of the user and special requirements (e.g., no other pets).

### Messaging & Scheduling

- **In-App Messaging:** Enables users to chat with shelter representatives after matching with a dog to arrange meet-ups.
- **Scheduling:** Users can book times to meet, walk, or foster the dog, with calendar integration for reminders.

### Shelter Dashboard

- **Shelter Login:** Separate login for shelters to manage their profiles, add or remove dogs, and update dog information.
- **Dog Management:** Shelters can upload dog profiles, photos, and set availability for fostering, walking, or playdates.
- **Match Management:** Shelters can approve or deny match requests from users and communicate with them directly through the app.

### Notifications

- **Push Notifications:** Alerts users about new dog profiles in their area, upcoming scheduled events, and messages from shelters.
- **In-App Notifications:** Notifies users of new matches, message responses, and reminders for scheduled appointments.

### Geolocation & Map Integration

- **Location-Based Matching:** Uses GPS to show dogs within a specified radius of the user’s location.
- **Shelter Map:** Displays a map view showing the locations of nearby shelters and available dogs.

### User Reviews & Feedback

- **Dog Experience Review:** Users can leave reviews about their experience with a dog, visible to the shelter and other potential users.
- **Shelter Feedback:** Users can provide feedback about their shelter experience.

### Adoption Integration

- **Adoption Info:** Includes an 'Adopt Me' button on dog profiles for users interested in adopting. Links to the shelter’s adoption page with detailed procedures.
- **Adoption Form:** Allows users to fill out an adoption interest form directly through the app if they want to adopt.

## Design Specifications

- **Theme & Colors:** Use a warm and welcoming color palette with pastel colors, light blues, greens, and oranges. Design should be modern and clean, inspired by Tinder’s UI.
- **Logo & Branding:** Incorporate a playful paw-themed logo with the app name “PawMatch.”

## Backend & Database

- **Backend:** Use a secure and scalable backend, such as Firebase or AWS Amplify, to manage user accounts, dog profiles, messaging, and scheduling data.
- **Database:** Ensure user data is encrypted and privacy-compliant, with efficient data handling and retrieval.

## Tech Stack Recommendations

- **Frontend:** Use React Native for cross-platform mobile app development.
- **Backend:** Use Firebase or AWS Amplify for user authentication, real-time database, and storage solutions.
- **APIs:** Integrate Google Maps API for location services and Twilio API for in-app messaging.

## Additional Notes

- **User Experience:** Ensure a smooth and responsive user experience with minimal lag during swipes and interactions.
- **Onboarding Flow:** Include a tutorial or onboarding process that guides new users through the app’s features upon their first login.
